## POwer Comsumation

Each matrix draws at full power 75W or 15amps

That would be 675w or 135 amps.

Running 1 grid on USB. Limited to 850mAh, it seem bright enough.

Let's say I limit each one to 2 amps. THat will be 19 amps.

I can buy a 40amp power supply for $29

Each panel is 160mm x 160mm

Each LED light is 10mm with a 0.5mm border

The diffuser tested best at 0.2mm thought you need to have your printer dialed to get a single layer
